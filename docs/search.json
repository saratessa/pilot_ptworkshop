    "text": "Problem Number One\nPT offers a measurement system that improves decision making quality of practitioners\nStudies suggest that PT can effectively improve skill acquisition in children with autism, leading to better retention, endurance, stability, and generalization of learned skills  (Wolking, 1980; White 2000; Mannion, 2022; Martinho et al., 2022).\n\nThe first motivating problem of my work is that PT gives us a really strong measurement system that helps practitioners make better decisions. We know this from research, precision teachers are more engaged with program data so they make more responsive choices that benefit their clients.\nWell how is this a problem? its a problem because even though it’s this powerful system, PT and the use of the Standard Celeration Chart aren’t part of the BACB task list. So, it usually doesn’t get taught in graduate programs. Which means most pre-licensure BCBAs are entering the field without this tool in their training."

I want to be clear that this excludes doctoral programs, bachelor’s programs, and master’s programs that are in education or psychology but have a VCS or ABA specialization. What I included here are only programs titled Masters in ABA or Masters in Behavior Analysis.\nBecause of that, it’s very possible this number is actually an underestimate.\nI pulled the data in two ways—first by looking at the ABAI website for programs with accreditation or seeking accreditation, and then by doing a Google search for ‘ABA master’s programs’ and going about five pages deep, making sure not to double count. And if it wasn’t obvious whether a program was online, hybrid, or in person, I emailed them directly to check.\nSo, given all of that, it’s probably conservative. But even so, at least 54% of pre-licensure BCBAs are doing their training online—and yet we have very little in the way of evidence-based instructional strategies designed specifically for that context."

One was a PhD doing research in precision teaching, and one was a practitioner with 5 years direct precision teaching and coaching other precision teachers.\nEach PT-er Viewed 3 SCCs each and I took a 1-min verbal sample of them describing the learning picture and identifying as many elements of the chart as they could\nVerbal descriptions were analyzed at two levels:\n• Quantitative level or how many elements per minute were listed (this ranged from 13 to 19 on average)\n• Descriptive level or what terminology was used, did the PT-ers make judgements on what changes they would program or do any prediction about how the program would progress based on the data they saw\nBased on this, we created a rubric to score participants within three ranges beginners (7-10 rubric score) intermediate (11-16 rubric score) and advanced (17-21 rubric score)"

Each week, participants completed a quiz in Canvas (baseline and 5 weeks of instruction). They were told to re-take the quiz as many times as needed until they reached 100% accuracy. From that, we got two measures: the time it took to reach 100% and the number of attempts. The quiz itself used a donated clinical SCC, and the very first question was always, ‘Describe the learning picture.’ We scored that written response with a rubric, while the remaining questions focused on chart elements and were multiple choice.\nAnother measure was graphing accuracy. Each week, participants received client data and notes in Canvas and were told simply to graph it—no instructions or guidance were provided. This was designed as a “structued form” or application check. At the end of the study, they were supposed to mail their completed graphs back to us. Spoiler alert: only one person actually mailed theirs in.\nFinally, at the very end of the study, participants completed a social validity survey to give their feedback.\nOn top of all of that, we tracked fluency outcomes during coaching sessions. These included timing floors, corrects and errors during practice, and verbal descriptions of learning pictures which we scored with the rubrics produced from the prework we did with the precision etachers.\nTaken together, these measures gave us a comprehensive picture of both accuracy and fluency across multiple types of tasks."

The idea was that they’d get to watch it build across the weeks, almost like a structured form that prepared them for what it feels like to really be a precision teacher.\nBut in practice, probably half of the students completed it no way to know if the other two did. And of those, the charts looked really different even though they had the same data, they picked different parts of the data to graph, they didn’t add notes, and they even skipped filling in labeled blanks. It was obvious this task wasn’t structured enough to get what we wanted to get out of it. Honestly, it wasn’t worth the amount of time it took to make the case study data.

From the list of possible decisions, the instructor will simulate the next week’s data to reflect that choice. This means not all participants will have the same dataset—rather, the data will respond to their decisions. This is much more efficient than creating multiple separate five-week data sets.\nc. In addition to showing their learning picture live, participants will also submit their chart before logging in for the coaching session. This will culminate in a Week 5 “chart share,” where they present their completed chart.

They aren’t a real child, but the computer gives them believable patterns of performance—sometimes better, sometimes worse, with a bit of variability like we’d expect in real life.\nWe also built in a set of teaching strategies. Each strategy has rules about what usually happens if you apply it. For example, frequency building usually increases correct responses, error correction reduces mistakes, and adding more opportunities means faster progress.\nNow, in practice, this is what you’ll experience as students in the workshop:\nFirst, we give you Week 1 data to chart. Everyone starts with the same setup, but the computer adds a bit of randomness so each group’s data looks slightly different.\nNext, your group looks at your chart and decides on a teaching strategy to try.\nOnce you decide, I run the computer program. In the background, R applies the rules for that strategy and generates a new week of data that reflects your choice.\nWe repeat this cycle for five weeks. Each time, you get a new set of data to chart, you make another decision, and the computer updates your learner again.\nAt the end, we’ll come together and share the charts, so you can compare how different decisions led to different learning patterns.\nSo the simple version is: you chart, you decide, the computer responds with new data."

Students could retake it until they got 100%.\nThe problem was that in baseline, responses were really short, like ‘I don’t know’ or ‘it’s a graph,’ so times looked fast. But as students improved, their answers got longer and more detailed, which actually made completion times slower. So ironically, higher skill inflated the scores. On top of that, students often just guessed on the multiple-choice questions, because thier first attempt would be a few minutes then the next 3 attempts were under a minute so its really clear they werre just selecting responses until they were at 100%."

    "text": "Next Steps\n\n\n\n\nwhere we’re headed next with this research program.\nFirst, we’re going to revise the materials. That means digging deeper into the literature, talking with experienced precision teachers, and really setting clear boundaries for the model in R so it’s solid from the start.\nNext, we’ll focus on recruitment. We plan to bring in more graduate students from the UO ABAO program to make sure we have enough participants to run this study well.\nThen, in January, we’ll launch the next study as an A–B design. This time, one group will go through all five weeks together. That setup is meant to address the attrition issues we saw in the pilot.\nAfter that, we’ll analyze the data with the MOST principles in mind—specifically continual optimization and resource management. In other words, we’ll look not only at whether it worked, but also how to refine and streamline it.\nAnd finally, once we’ve learned from this iteration, we’ll move into a full optimization phase where we test combinations of components more systematically.\nSo, this next step is really about tightening up what we’ve already built, making it more feasible, and setting ourselves up for the larger optimization trial."

This will extend beyond PT training to inform the design of evidence-based online ABA education more broadly.\nLong-Term Goal: Produce a packaged, optimized, and scalable online Precision Teaching workshop that graduate programs can adopt to address the PT training gap for pre-licensure BCBAs."
